[View Live Project Here](#)

## Overview 

Cook House is a website that focuses on bringing strangers and friends together through the simple art of food, drink and conversation. The purpose of this website is for like minded users that either want to attend or host private supper clubs in their own homes to be able to do so through this platform. Users will be able to create an event in order to host their own evening which will be open invitation (with limited numbers) for any other members of the website. The author of the event will be able to choose the cuisine, dress code and other optional extras. Users will also be able to leave reviews on hosts profile as well as ask further questions on the event post. This project will have a strong focus on database creation and usage.
